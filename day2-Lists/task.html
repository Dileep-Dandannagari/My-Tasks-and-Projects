        <h2><b><i>About Me</i></b></h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is <b>D.Dileep</b>. I am currently residing in Hyderabad and originally from Kurnool.
            I have completed my graduation in Mechanical engineering from sree vahini institute of science and technology.
            Being a fresher I don't have any professional experience but I have strong grasp of various technologies like jdbc, jsp, servlet, html 
            css, JS and my proficiency shines in Java programming language. In short term I aspire to secure a challenging role in 
            a reputed company and my long term goal is to get into a leadership position where I can make substancial impact
            on company growth. And I am always eager to actively engage in projects that will enhance my technical abilities.

            <dd>A computer is a machine that can be programmed to automatically carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations 
                (computation). Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as 
                programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. The term computer system
                 may refer to a nominally complete computer that includes the hardware, operating system, software, and 
                 peripheral equipment needed and used for full operation; or to a group of computers that are linked and 
                 function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.</dd>
